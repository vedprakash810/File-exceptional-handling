        "memory management**\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Exception handling in Python is a way to respond to unexpected errors that can cause a program to terminate.\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The purpose of a finally block in exception handling is to ensure that important code is executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The del method in Python, also known as a destructor method, is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used to perform cleanup, release resources, or other finalization actions.\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-  If you use import statement only than you can use all the functionality of that module but if you use from and import together than you can only use the specific functionality.   \n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions in a single try-except block by using a tuple of exception types.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The with statement in Python is used to simplify the management of resources that need to be acquired and released in a specific order.\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Multithreading-\n",
        "Uses a single process with multiple threads to run concurrently. Each thread runs a process, and all threads share the resources of that process. Multithreading is quick to create and requires few resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing-\n",
        "Uses multiple processors to run multiple processes in parallel. Each processor can run one or more threads, and each process has its own dedicated resources.\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Logging in a program has many advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Troubleshooting-\n",
        "Logging records all system activity, which makes it easy to track down and fix issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Security-\n",
        "Logging records all user actions, which can help identify suspicious behavior.\n",
        "Monitoring-\n",
        "Logging can help developers monitor applications and identify issues by tracking user and process actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Better than print statements-\n",
        "Logging is more flexible than print statements, which can't be turned off without changing the source code.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Memory management in Python is the process of automatically allocating and releasing memory to ensure that programs run efficiently.\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The basic steps in exception handling in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Test code: Use the try block to test code where exceptions are likely to occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Handle exceptions: If an exception occurs, Python looks for a matching block to handle it. The except block is executed if an exception is raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Continue running: After the block is executed, the program continues running as usual.\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Memory management is important in Python because it helps ensure that memory is used efficiently, which can lead to faster processing times and less demand on other system resources.\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, the try and except blocks are used to handle exceptions, or errors, that can occur in a program.\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Python's garbage collection (GC) is an automated process that manages memory by identifying and removing objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Python's logging module has six standard logging levels that indicate the severity of an event:\n",
        "\n",
        "Notset: The default setting of a log.\n",
        "\n",
        "Debug: The least threatening level, with detailed information for diagnosing issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Info: Confirmation that the application is working as expected\n",
        "Warning: An indication that something unexpected happened, or a potential problem might arise soon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error: Indicates a significant issue that has prevented certain functions from executing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Critical: A severe error suggesting that the program may be unable to continue running.\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The fork method is only supported on POSIX-based systems like Linux and macOS (not Windows), whereas the spawn start method is supported on all platforms. A major difference between the two start methods is speed.  It is generally considered that forking a process is faster than multiprocessing.\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Read method reads the whole file as a single string while readlines segregates each of the line in the file and you then can later on call them line by line.\n",
        "21.  What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Python logging is a module that allows you to track events that occur while your program is running.\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc.\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Some challenges with memory management in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Slower program runtimes-\n",
        "Python may hold freed memory in the interpreter instead of freeing it up for the operating system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory exhaustion-\n",
        "Without proper garbage collection, unused memory can accumulate over time, leading to memory exhaustion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance degradation-\n",
        "Improper memory management can slow down the application and server components.\n",
        "24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows for concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single program.\n",
